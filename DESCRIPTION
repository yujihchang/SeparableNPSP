Description: Tools to estimate separable direct and indirect effects for mediation
    analysis in (semi)competing risks. The package implements two complementary
    estimators: (1) a model-free nonparametric method based on counting-process
    / multistate hazard decomposition, and (2) a semiparametric method that
    leverages Cox proportional hazards models to flexibly adjust for confounders.
    Both approaches target counterfactual risk contrasts under an exposure split
    into disjoint components (affecting the primary outcome directly versus via
    the intermediate outcome). Methods are motivated by and derived in:
    Yu and Huang (2025) "Separable Effects of Semicompeting Risks: The Effects of
    Hepatitis B on Liver Cancer via Liver Cirrhosis", Statistics in Medicine, doi:10.1002/sim.70178.
